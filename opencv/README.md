The idea here is to learn about opencv in order to make other projects with the camera such as object detection.

We first install opencv using process described here:
https://forum.opencv.org/t/installing-opencv-on-raspberry-pi-zero-1-3-w-with-python-picamera/3999

 $ sudo apt install python3-opencv
 
 We can test that it is well installed with:
 
 >>> import cv2

>>> cv2.__version__
